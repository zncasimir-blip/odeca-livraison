ODECA - Build & Install Instructions (Quick)

1) GitHub automatic build (no Flutter locally):
 - Create a GitHub repo and push the entire project folder (odeca_project_full contents).
 - Ensure the Flutter app lives in odeca_app/ at repo root.
 - On GitHub, go to Actions > Build Android APK, run the workflow or push to main.
 - After success, download artifact 'odeca-apk' (contains app-release.apk).

2) Local build (optional):
 - cd odeca_app
 - flutter pub get
 - flutter build apk --release
 - Install: adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

3) Backend (local testing):
 - cd odeca_backend && npm install
 - Set env vars: MANAGER_EMAIL, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS
 - Start: node server.js
 - On Android emulator, use http://10.0.2.2:3000/send-order

4) Replacing placeholders:
 - Replace assets/images/mockup1.png, mockup2.png and assets/images/logo.png with real images.
 - Update agent USSD codes in lib/src/screens/checkout_screen.dart 'agentCodes' map.

5) Notes:
 - The app triggers USSD only after the backend confirms email sent.
 - iOS requires Apple Developer account for native install. For iOS users recommend hosting web version and use 'Add to Home Screen'.
